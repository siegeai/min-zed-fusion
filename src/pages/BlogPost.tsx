      title: "Why Email Still Runs the World",
      content: `
        <p>People love saying email is broken. But if email is broken, why does every serious conversation still start there? It's not broken. It's overloaded.</p>
        
        <p>Think about your inbox right now. Customer complaints mixed with sales leads. Bug reports next to investor updates. Job applications buried under spam. It's like that kitchen drawer where you throw everything - batteries, rubber bands, takeout menus, mystery keys. You know exactly what I'm talking about.</p>

        <h2>The Kitchen Drawer Problem</h2>
        <p>Every startup founder knows this pain. You're wearing 47 different hats, and every email could be the difference between success and failure. But here's the thing - you can't tell which is which until you open it.</p>

        <p>Big companies solve this with people. They hire specialists to sort through everything. Customer success teams for support emails. Sales teams for leads. HR for applications. But when you're bootstrapping? That person is you.</p>

        <h2>What If Every Email Came Pre-Labeled?</h2>
        <p>Imagine if every email that hit your inbox already knew what it was. Customer issues automatically categorized by urgency. Sales leads scored and tracked. Bug reports routed to the right person. Investor emails flagged for priority.</p>

        <p>That's not magic. That's just AI doing what it does best - pattern recognition at scale.</p>

        <h2>The Future Is Already Here</h2>
        <p>We're building tools that don't replace email - they make it work the way it should have from the beginning. Smart, organized, and focused on what matters most to your business.</p>

        <p>Because the problem was never email itself. The problem was trying to drink from a fire hose without knowing what's water and what's gasoline.</p>
